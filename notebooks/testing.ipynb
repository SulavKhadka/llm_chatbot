    "\n",
    "Intrigued by the claims of emergent reasoning capabilities in LLMs trained on general web corpora, in this paper, we set out to investigate their planning capabilities. We aim to evaluate (1) the effectiveness of LLMs in generating plans autonomously in commonsense planning tasks and (2) the potential of LLMs as a source of heuristic guidance for other agents (AI planners) in their planning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We conduct a systematic study by generating a suite of instances on domains similar to the ones employed in the International Planning Competition and evaluate LLMs in two distinct modes: autonomous and heuristic . Our findings reveal that LLMs' ability to generate executable plans autonomously is rather limited, with the best model (GPT-4) having an average success rate of ~12% across the domains. However, the results in the heuristic mode show more promise. In the heuristic mode, we demonstrate that LLM-generated plans can improve the search process for underlying sound planners and additionally show that external verifiers can help provide feedback on the generated plans and back-prompt the LLM for better plan generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be no exaggeration to say that transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP). Kicked off by the advances presented by the GPT-x models developed by OpenAI [25], these types of language models currently provide state-of-the-art performance in many of the standard NLP tasks. Although LLMs were originally developed mostly to do word sequence completion tasks, with no guarantees about the completion beyond its coherence, there have been increasing claims and anecdotal evidence that they have other emergent capabilities that are not normally associated with sequence completion. Indeed, the hints of such emergent capabilities has started a veritable land rush, with researchers probing (prompting) and studying LLM behavior almost as if they were artificial organisms (c.f. [15]). Of particular interest to us in this paper is the thread of efforts that aim to investigate (and showcase) reasoning abilities of LLMs–including commonsense reasoning [30, 26, 7], logical reasoning [29], and even ethical reasoning [14]. The macro-tenor of the drumbeat of these works has been suggesting that LLM's are indeed capable of doing such kinds of reasoning [17, 31, 4].\n",
    "\n",
    "One type of reasoning task that has been well studied in the AI community is planning and sequential decision making. At its simplest, planning involves developing a course of actions (policy) which when executed takes the agent to a desired state of the world. Planning has generally been studied primarily as an inference on world and reward models–whether specified by humans or learned by the agent by interacting with its world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, we are interested in seeing what planning abilities, if any, LLMs may already have, given their high capacity functions (with billions of tunable parameters) trained on web-scale corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we are interested in answering two broad questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How effective are LLMs by themselves in generating simple plans in commonsense planning tasks (of the type that humans are generally quite good at)?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How good are LLMs in being a source of heuristic guidance for other agents in their planning tasks?\n",
    "Notice that in theory it is possible for LLMs to be very effective as idea generators for external sound planners or humans in the loop in computer-supported cooperative work scenarios, while themselves being very bad at generating plans that are guaranteed to be correct. This is especially likely because the chief power of LLMs comes from their pattern finding abilities than on first-principles simulations over world models.  Compared to a planner that is guaranteed to be correct in a narrow set of domains, LLMs may likely be good at generating plausible (but not guaranteed to be correct) plan heuristics/suggestions in many more domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate these questions in a systematic rather than anecdotal manner, we generate a suite of planning problem instances based on the kinds of domains employed in the International Planning Competition [13]. To eliminate the subjective aspect of analysis that forms the core part of many earlier efforts on evaluating reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we automate the evaluation by leveraging models and tools from the automated planning community. 1\n",
    "\n",
    "![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation itself is done in two modes (shown in Figure 1). In the first \"autonomous\" mode, LLMs are used standalone, and we directly assess the quality and correctness of plans they generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we shall see, the results in the autonomous mode are pretty bleak. On an average, only about 12% of the plans that the best LLM (GPT-4) generates are actually executable without errors and reach their goals. We will show that the choice of the specific LLM (we have tested the family of GPT LLMs including GPT-4 [23], GPT-3.5 [22], InstructGPT-3 [24] and GPT-3 [3]), as well as fine tuning does not seem to have a major effect on this dismal performance. We also show that the performance deteriorates further if the names of the actions and objects in the domain are obfuscated–a change that doesn't in anyway affect the performance of the standard AI planners. To shed further light on the performance of GPT4, we present an evaluation of the plans it generates under a series of more relaxed (more forgiving) executability conditions. Further, we provide a human baseline for the simplest domain in our set of domains, by presenting the planning instances to human subjects\n",
    "(through IRB-approved studies) and evaluating the quality and correctness of their plans. These results are substantially better than those of LLMs–confirming that LLMs can't plan even in a simple common sense domain in the autonomous mode. In the second \"heuristic\" mode, the plans produced by LLMs are given as input to an automated planner working off of a correct domain model to check 2 The related tools as well as experiment code will be made available in the following repo: https://\n",
    "github.com/karthikv792/gpt-plan-benchmark whether the LLM's plans help with the search process of the underlying planner to come up with correct plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically we show that a well known automated planner called LPG [6], that uses local search to locate and remove flaws in a candidate plan to make it correct, is able to repair the LLM plans with relative ease. We compare the LLM+LPG combination with two baselines, one where an empty plan is used as the seed plan for the LPG and two, where a random plan is provided as the seed plan to the LPG. We show that the average search steps by the LLM+LPG combination is much lesser than both the baselines, thereby revealing that LLMs' plans are indeed helping with the search process of the underlying planner. Further, instead of having LPG correct the plans, we use an external verifier, VAL [11], to point out the errors in the LLM-generated plans and back-prompt the LLM for a new plan with this feedback. We show that this repeated interaction indeed improves the plan correctness in common-sense domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, our findings demonstrate that, with respect to planning, LLMs' perform poorly in the autonomous mode but the generated plans can help AI planners in the search process or can be given to external verifiers and back-prompt the LLM for better plans. In this paper, we first present an overview of the related work. Following that, we describe the necessary background and the prompt generation pipeline. Finally, we provide the results and analysis of various experiments undertaken in both autonomous and heuristic evaluation modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 Related Work\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, we look at LLMs' planning capabilities when the domain is given as part of the prompt\n",
    "(as is the standard practice in automated planning [8]). Our evaluation focuses on zero shot (just domain and problem specification), and few-shot (example problems with plans) modes.  There have been a few earlier works that looked at the planning capabilities of LLMs. Most of them, such as [12, 2] focus on commonsense domains/tasks (e.g. moving things in kitchens, wedding/menu planning etc.) and thus evaluate LLMs in a mode wherein the prompt doesn't include any information about the specific domain. Plans generated in that way are hard to evaluate as they are not directed at any plan executor and the humans often wind up giving benefit of doubt for a plausibile–but not actually executable–plan. This is why in SayCan [2], where executability is critical, they try to filter out/interpret the LLM plans in terms of the skills/actions that are actually available to the executor.\n",
    "\n",
    "While SayCan does this in a rather convoluted way that requires access to the internal log probabilities of the LLM, our approach of specifying the domain as part of the prompt ensures that the generated plans only use the actions in the domain specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "One other mode of evaluation of planning capabilities in the literature involves the user incrementally interacting with the LLM, and re-prompting it to point out flaws in its plans, with the hope that the LLM eventually reaches an executable plan [33]. Such evaluations are notorious for their Clever Hans effect [1] with the actual planning being done by the humans in the loop rather than the LLMs themselves. We thus separate our evaluation into two modes–autonomous and as assistants to external planners/reasoners.\n",
    "\n",
    "There have also been efforts which mostly depended on LLMs as \"translators\" of natural language problem/goal specification into formal specifications, which are then thrown over to sound external planners [32, 19]. Such efforts don't shed any light on the internal planning capabilities of the LLMs themselves, as our evaluations in autonomous and assistive modes do. Finally, after our initial study and benchmark were made public, other groups did parallel studies that largely corroborate our results on the ineffectiveness of LLMs in finding executable plans [28, 19].\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a broader perspective, making plans in the world involves (1) discovering actions (and their precondition/effect causal dependencies), and (2) sequencing an appropriate subset of available/discovered actions to achieve the agent's goals. The former requires broad knowledge about actions available in the world and their individual effects, while the latter requires deep drilling-down over a given set of actions to ensure that all goals are supported (causal chaining) without any undesirable interactions. LLMs have an edge on the former–they do indeed have web-scale broad knowledge! As we shall see however, they are very bad at the second phase of developing valid interaction-free plans\n",
    "(in part, because LLMs don't have the ability to do combinatorial search). Most cases in literature where LLMs are claimed to have \"planned\" turn out, upon close examination, to be instances of phase 1–your wedding plans, recipe plans etc.–where you are either using a very forgiving plan correctness criterion, or the phase 2 is vacuous. Standard AI planners–on the other hand–assume that the discovery part is done and handed down as a compact domain model, and focus mostly on the second part: selecting among known actions to establish causal chains and sequencing them to make them interaction free. In this sense, LLMs and AI planners can be complementary, as we have shown in this paper–with the former helping with phase 1–either with a candidate/approximate plan or domain model–and the latter with phase 2. \n",
