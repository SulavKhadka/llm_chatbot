    "Feed-forward layers constitute two-thirds of a transformer model's parameters, yet their role in the network remains under-explored.  We show that feed-forward layers in transformerbased language models operate as key-value memories, where each key correlates with textual patterns in the training examples, and each value induces a distribution over the output vocabulary.  Our experiments show that the learned patterns are human-interpretable, and that lower layers tend to capture shallow patterns, while upper layers learn more semantic The values complement the keys' inones.\n",

    "put patterns by inducing output distributions that concentrate probability mass on tokens likely to appear immediately after each pattern, particularly in the upper layers.  Finally, we demonstrate that the output of a feed-forward layer is a composition of its memories, which is subsequently refined throughout the model's layers via residual connections to produce the final output distribution.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformer-based language models (Vaswani et al., 2017) are at the core of state-of-the-art natural language processing (Devlin et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020), largely due to the success of selfattention. While much literature has been devoted to analyzing the function of self-attention layers\n",
    "(Voita et al., 2019 ; Clark et al., 2019 ; Vig and Belinkov, 2019 ), they account for only a third of a typical transformer's parameters (4 d 2 per layer, where d is the model's hidden dimension).  Most of the parameter budget is spent on position-wise feedforward layers (8d 2 per layer), yet their role remains under-explored. What, if so, is the function of feed-forward layers in a transformer language model?\n",
    "\n",
    "We show that feed-forward layers emulate neural memories (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015 ), where the first\n",

    "and the second parameter matrix to values . Figure 1 shows how the keys (first parameter matrix) interact with the input to produce coefficients, which are then used to compute a weighted sum of the values (second parameter matrix) as the output. While the theoretical similarity between feed-forward layers and key-value memories has previously been suggested by Sukhbaatar et al. ( 2019 ), we take this observation one step further, and analyze the\n",

    "\n",
    "We find that each key correlates with a specific set of human-interpretable input patterns, such as n-grams or semantic topics.  For example, k 2 in Figure 1 is triggered by inputs that describe a pe-\n",

Simultaneously, we observe that each value can induce a distribution over the output vocabulary, and that this distribution correlates with the next-token distribution of the corresponding keys in the upper layers of the model.  In the above example, the corresponding value v 2 represents a distribution that puts most of its probability mass on the word \"while\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we analyze how the language model, as a whole, composes its final prediction from individual memories. We observe that each layer combines hundreds of active memories, creating a distribution that is qualitatively different from each of its component memories' values. Meanwhile, the residual connection between layers acts as a refinement mechanism, gently tuning the prediction at each layer while retaining most of the residual's information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, our work sheds light on the function of feed-forward layers in transformer-based language models. We show that feed-forward layers act as pattern detectors over the input across all layers, and that the final output distribution is gradually constructed in a bottom-up fashion. 1\n",

    "\n",
    "Feed-forward layers  A transformer language model (Vaswani et al., 2017) is made of intertwined self-attention and feed-forward layers. Each feedforward layer is a position-wise function, processing each input vector independently. Let x ∈ R d be a vector corresponding to some input text prefix. We can express the feed-forward layer FF( · ) as follows (bias terms are omitted):\n",

    "Neural memory A neural memory (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) consists of d m key-value pairs, which we call memories. 2  Each key is represented by a d-dimensional vector k i ∈ R d , and together form the parameter matrix K ∈ R dm × d ; likewise, we define the value parameters as V E R dm ×d . Given an input vector x ∈ R d , we compute a distribution over the keys, and use it to compute the expected value:\n",

    "Feed-forward layers emulate neural memory Comparing equations 1 and 2 shows that feedforward layers are almost identical to key-value neural memories; the only difference is that neural memory uses softmax as the non-linearity f ( · ),\n",

We refer to each m i as the memory coefficient of the ith memory cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) make an analogous observation, and incorporate the parameters of the feed-forward layers as persistent memory cells in the self-attention layers. While this reparameterization works in practice, the experiment does not tell us much about the role of feed-forward layers in the canonical transformer. If transformer feed-forward layers are indeed key-value memories, then what memories do they store?\n",
    "\n",
    "We conjecture that each key vector k i captures a particular pattern (or set of patterns) in the input sequence (Section 3 ), and that its corresponding value vector v i represents the distribution of tokens that follows said pattern (Section 4).\n",

    "To test our claim, we analyze the keys of a trained language model's feed-forward layers. We first retrieve the training examples (prefixes of a sentence) most associated with a given key, that is, the input texts where the memory coefficient is highest.

A possible explanation is that the lower layers do not operate in the same embedding space, and therefore, projecting values onto the vocabulary using the output embeddings does not produce distributions that follow the trigger examples. However, our results imply that some intermediate layers do operate in the same or similar space to upper layers (exhibiting some agreement), which in itself is non-trivial.

    "Here, the validation set is used (rather than the training set used to find trigger examples) since we are trying to characterize the model's behavior at inference time, not find the examples it \"memorizes\" during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first measure the fraction of \"active\" memories (cells with a non-zero coefficient). Figure 7 shows that a typical example triggers hundreds of memories per layer (10%-50% of 4096 dimensions), but the majority of cells remain inactive.\n",

Perhaps surprisingly, when the residual's prediction does change ( composition+ffn ), it rarely changes to the feed-forward layer's prediction ( ffn ).  Instead, we observe that composing the residual's distribution with that of the feed-forward layer produces a \"compromise\" prediction, which is equal to neither ( composition ).\n",

    "This behavior is similar to the intra-layer composition we observe in Section 5.1. A possible conjecture is that the feed-forward layer acts as an elimination mechanism to \"veto\" the top prediction in the residual, and thus shifts probability mass towards one of the other candidate predictions in the head of the residual's distribution.\n",

    "Considerable attention has been given to demystifying the operation of neural NLP models.  An extensive line of work targeted neuron functionality in general, extracting the properties that neurons and subsets of neurons capture (Durrani et al., 2020; Dalvi et al., 2019 ; Rethmeier et al., 2020 ; Mu and Andreas, 2020; Vig et al., 2020), regardless of the model architecture or neurons' position in it. Jacovi et al. (2018) analyzed CNN architectures in text classification and showed that they extract key n-grams from the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study of the transformer architecture has focused on the role and function of self-attention layers (Voita et al., 2019 ; Clark et al., 2019 ; Vig and Belinkov, 2019) and on inter-layer differences\n",
    "(i.e. lower vs. upper layers) (Tenney et al., 2019; Jawahar et al., 2019 ).  Previous work also highlighted the importance of feed-forward layers in transformers (Press et al., 2020; Pulugundla et al.,\n",

    "## Discussion And Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how and why transformers work is crucial to many aspects of modern NLP, including model interpretability, data security, and development of better models. Feed-forward layers account for most of a transformer's parameters, yet little is known about their function in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, we propose that feed-forward layers emulate key-value memories, and provide a set of experiments showing that: (a) keys are correlated with human-interpretable input patterns; (b)\n",
    "values, mostly in the model's upper layers, induce distributions over the output vocabulary that correlate with the next-token distribution of patterns in the corresponding key; and (c) the model's output is formed via an aggregation of these distributions, whereby they are first composed to form individual layer outputs, which are then refined throughout the model's layers using residual connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our findings open important research directions:\n",
    "- Layer embedding space. We observe a correlation between value distributions over the output vocabulary and key patterns, that increases from lower to upper layers (Section 4 ). Is this because the layer's output space transforms across layers? If so, how? We note that this possible transformation cannot be explained solely by the function of feed-forward layers: if the model only did a series of key-value look-ups and value-distribution aggregation via weighted addition, then a single, unifying embedding space would appear more natural. Thus, the transformation might have to do with the interplay between feed-forward layers and self-attention layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Beyond language modeling.  Our formulation of feed-forward networks as key-value memories generalizes to any transformer model, e.g. BERT encoders and neural translation models. We thus expect our qualitative empirical observations to hold across diverse settings, and leave verification of this for future work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Practical implications. A better understanding of feed-forward layers has many implications in NLP. For example, future studies may offer interpretability methods by automating the patternidentification process; memory cells might affect training-data privacy as they could facilitate white-box membership inference (Nasr et al., 2019 ); and studying cases where a correct pattern is identified but then suppressed during aggregation may guide architectural novelties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, by illuminating the role of feed-forward layers, we move towards a better understanding of the inner workings of transformers, and open new research threads on modern NLP models.\n",
