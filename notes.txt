- way to notify/talk back to user for reminders or monitoring alerts
- agent tasks can be performed in various times of the conversations: 
    - realtime blocking: as the conversation is going, finishing task before moving to output or further processing.
    - concurrently: kick of the task in an async format and keep processing current input until results come back and gets mixed in before replying.
    - scheduled: doesnt need to happen right now, need to be done before next session or some other timeframe larger than the current turn/session.
